## Preface

This Documentation intends to give you an overview of the Node Editor. It was initially posted by me, [Seneral](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/), 
back in May 2015 as a personal project on the [Unity Forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/simple-node-editor.189230/#post-2134738).
After receiving a great amount of positive feedback I continued improving and supporting it, now, with the help of the community, featuring a lot of major features you'd expect from a great Node Editor!

The [Github Repository](https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor) was set up by [Baste](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/baste.185905/) 
during the early development, and now it's the main platform to share and contribute to Node Editor.

<br> <br>

## Features

The Node Editor has some unique features despite being Open-Source, which we're proud of featuring:

- Full interface with all expected controls like zooming/panning
- Flexible and interchangeable GUI
- Canvas and Editor State system featuring alot of advanced controls
- Super easy to extend with custom nodes, types and even controls without modifying the provided code
- Powerful calculation system, soon revamped for complete flexibility
- Extreme Node customization to create totally unique node appearances achieved by a custom windowing system
- Growing Runtime support, including every bit from the EditorWindow

The framework also shines with clean and easy to modify code. It's clearly separated in multiple parts, 
some of which can even be taken and used somewhere else, such as the unique, generic scaling approach!

## Contributing

Since the initial start quite a few people took the time and motivation to contribute to the project which we all appreciate very much! 
You can check all contributions out on the contributions page. But also those who use, test and report bugs are very important for this project.

If you wish to contribute, you may take a look at the [Issues page of Github](https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor/issues) as a rough guideline what is planned and how you can help. 
Of course, own ideas are just as fine. Make sure to let us know if you are making an extension using Node Editor, may it be big or small, and notify me about any problems you may encounter:)
This is vital to the project!

Also, you can always contact Seneral with a PM on the Forums for questions on the framework:)
